            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Im a teen programmer, who loves making sites and things with code. I also wander around with a camera and take pictures of stuff. I'm not very good at writing though, so keeping people entertained while reading bodies of text like this isn't really my thing</p>
            <h2>About this site</h2>
            <p>This site was created when I didn't have anything better to do. I started off with <a href="//muute.net" target="_blank">Muute</a> but the things I wanted to do started to drift away from Muute's original goal. Thats when this was formed, a site for me to show my work, and muck around with stuff. I open-sourced this so others can see my code easily, and to take advantage of the free hosting on <a href="//pages.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. It uses the <a href="/LICENSE">MIT License</a>, so everyone can use the code</p>
            <h2>How can I say hi?</h2>
            <p>Im on <a href="//twitter.com/asherfoster">Twitter</a> more or less all the time, and you can repoort bugs <a href="https://github.com/AsherFoster/asherfoster.github.com/issues">over on GitHub</a>. Or even better, if you want to get your own site made by me, <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/Ashernz.html">I'm on Freelancer</a></p>
